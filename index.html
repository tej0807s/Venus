        <p>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
            brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare
            occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears
            to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while
            before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and
            a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis
            than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This
            means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.[20] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it
            shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.

            Internal structure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Without seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information is available about the
            internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth
            suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the
            Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about
            the same rate, although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out. The slightly smaller size of Venus
            means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The predicted values for the moment of
            inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900–3,450 km. This is in line with the first
            observation-based estimate of 3,500km.

            Atmosphere and climate
        </h2>
        <p>
            Venus has an extremely dense atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen—both exist as
            supercritical fluids at the planet's surface—and traces of other gases including sulfur dioxide. The mass of
            its atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface is about 93 times that at
            Earth's—a pressure equivalent to that at a depth of nearly 1 km (5⁄8 mi) under Earth's oceans. The density
            at the surface is 65 kg/m3, 6.5% that of water or 50 times as dense as Earth's atmosphere at 293 K (20 °C;
            68 °F) at sea level.

            Volcanism
        </h2>
        <p>
            Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity. Venus has several times as
            many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167 large volcanoes that are over 100 km (60 mi) across. The only
            volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.:154 This is not because Venus is more
            volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older and is not subject the same erosion process.
            Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an
            average age of about a hundred million years, whereas the Venusian surface is estimated to be 300–600
            million years old.
